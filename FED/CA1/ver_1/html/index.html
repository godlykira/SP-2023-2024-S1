                <br /> I am always looking for new information and ideas,
                <br /> experiences that will push me to grow and evolve as a person.</h3>

                <p>
                    My interests in the context of saving the planet are centered on environmental activism and conservation efforts. 
                    I enjoy learning about the latest advancements in sustainable technology and renewable energy, 
                    as well as exploring ways to live a more eco-friendly lifestyle.
                    <br />
                    <br /> I also enjoy gardening and growing my own food, which not only reduces my carbon footprint but also brings me closer to the earth.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Overall, my goal with this website is to share my passion for environmental protection and inspire others to take action to save the planet.
