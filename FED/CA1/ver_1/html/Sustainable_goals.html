                <p>There are numerous strategies to lower your carbon footprint, which is the amount of CO2 <br>
                    and other greenhouse gases generated into the atmosphere as a result of human activity. <br>
                    Here are some effective strategies to consider:

                        &nbsp;Turn off the lights when natural light is sufficient and when you leave the room. It’s that simple!

                <p>
                    &nbsp;The easiest way to reduce waste is to practice the 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.

                        &nbsp;You might already have a reusable water bottle, but do you use it all the time? You can put that reusable bottle to use, save money and reduce waste. By taking your own water with you, you’ll also reduce your chances of purchasing more expensive beverages on-the-go.

                        &nbsp;Just like a reusable water bottle, you may already have a reusable grocery bag, though it’s often forgotten at home. Try writing BAGS on the top of your grocery list to help you remember, or keep them in the back seat where they aren’t as easy to forget.

                        &nbsp;You can reduce the amount of waste you produce by purchasing products that come with less packaging and/or come in packaging that can be recycled.

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;In today's digital age, most businesses send bills through email, and some even give incentives to do so. More retailers are also giving e-receipts, which are useful because they are less likely to be misplaced if you need to return something. Consider purchasing digital subscriptions to your favorite magazines to read on your tablet or computer. Digital subscriptions are frequently less expensive than hard-copy versions.
